About : >
 I am currently a Computer Scientist at [NASA IMPACT](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact), where my 
 research focuses on building and scaling AI Foundation Models for Science. I completed my MS by Research 
 under the supervision of [Dr. Amit K. Roy Chowdhury](https://vcg.ece.ucr.edu/amit)  
 at University of California-Riverside, where my thesis explored 3D human pose estimation for the 
 [IARPA BRIAR](https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/briar) project. 
  
 Prior this, I worked at IISc Bangalore’s [Visual Computing Lab](https://visual-computing.in/), focusing on 
 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and Adversarial Vulnerability in Computer Vision algorithms. 
   
 Outside of my research, I’m passionate about traveling, hiking, photography, and video editing—and I’m always up for a 
 game of table tennis! I enjoy connecting with new people and learning their stories, so don’t hesitate to reach out.
